    <div class="question">
      <h3>What are Medium processing power IoT devices?</h3>
      <p>Medium processing power IoT devices are devices that do receive updates and may have password authentication.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <h3>What are High processing power IoT devices?</h3>
      <p>High processing power IoT devices are devices that have a complex user interface on the device with other capabilities.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
      <h3>Why should devices with default passwords be avoided?</h3>
